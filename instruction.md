Here is a detailed markdown document suitable for your website project mcp.new, focusing on MCP documentation, alongside a JSON representation for the top 20 MCP servers.

Model Context Protocol Documentation

Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how developers integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and data sources. Developed by Anthropic, MCP enables versatile AI applications across various domains, from IDEs to chatbots. MCP leverages a robust ecosystem of hosts, clients, and servers to provide seamless context integration.

Key Components
	1.	Resources: Expose external data to LLMs.
	2.	Prompts: Reusable templates and workflows.
	3.	Tools: Facilitate server-side actions.
	4.	Sampling: Request LLM completions from servers.
